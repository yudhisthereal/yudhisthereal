# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yudhistira

## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering with a passion for embedded systems and robotics. My journey in the world of technology began with a curiosity about how things work, and it has led me to explore various aspects of software and hardware development.

## My Interests

- **Embedded Systems**: I love working with microcontrollers and designing efficient systems that interact with the physical world.
- **Robotics**: From autonomous vehicles to robotic arms, I enjoy building intelligent machines that can perform tasks autonomously.
- **C++**: My primary programming language, I enjoy diving deep into its intricacies, especially in the context of embedded development.
- **Python**: Who doesn't love Python and it's concise syntax? I use this for image processing, visualizing data, and robotics motion programming.
- **Open Source**: I'm a strong advocate for open-source software, and am looking forward to contribute to projects that make technology accessible to everyone.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- **Automatic Fish Feeder**: An Arduino Nano-based automatic feeder for your fish, utilizing real-time clock (RTC) modules and servo motors to automate feeding.
- **Ultrasonic Person Counter**: A device that can count people in a room (not exactly) by counting up when someone enters and counting down when someone exits.
- **Smart Fan (IoT)**: This Smart Fan turns on automatically if the temperature is above the user defined threshold. It's mode (auto or manual), sweep (on or off), and rotation can be controlled using Blynk on my mobile device!
